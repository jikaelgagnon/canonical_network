# Canonical Network
This builds on an existing repo by [_Kaba et. al_](https://github.com/oumarkaba/canonical_network/tree/main/canonical_network) in which they create code that implements their canonicalization functions from their paper 
_Equivariance with Learned Canonicalization_(https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06489). Changes include a new Transformer implementation, documentation of functions, and various bug fixes.
